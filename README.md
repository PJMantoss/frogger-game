Frogger is an arcade game developed in 1981 by Konami and originally published by Sega. The object of the game is to direct frogs to their homes one by one by crossing a busy road and navigating a river full of hazards. The frog starts at the bottom of the screen, which contains a horizontal road occupied by cars, trucks, and bulldozers speeding along it. The player must guide the frog between opposing lanes of traffic to avoid becoming roadkill, which results in a loss of a life. The upper portion of the screen consists of a river with logs, moving horizontally across the screen. By jumping on swiftly moving logs the player can guide their frog to safety.
